Scripts demonstraiting and benchmarking the inh_gamma_generator(_ng):

bench.py - a benchmark using inh_gamma_generator, and multiple generator 
           objects for multiple realizations.
bench_ng.py - equivalent implementation of bench.py using
              inh_gamma_generator _S selective connections and the 
	      independent multiple targets feature

bench_poisson.py - single poisson generators provide independent realizations to multiple targets.

bench_poisson_parrot.py - All Poisson processes are piped through a parrot neuron to allow STDP
                          and dynamic synapses

bench_poisson_single.py - All Poisson processes are pooled into one with a single aggregated rate.

NB: For STDP or dynamic synapses, one must use either bench_poisson_parrot.py, bench_ng.py, or bench.py.
bench_ng.py is 13 times faster than bench_poisson_parrot.py.
bench_poisson_parrot.py is only 1.3 times faster than bench.py.
bench_ng.py requires _S (selective) connectors.

test_ng.py - comparison of inh_gamma_generator and inh_gamma_generator_ng
             spike trains.


ac_gamma_psth.py - compute the PSTH for a sinusoidally modulated
                   inhomogeneous gamma renewal process with a!=1.0.

step_gamma_psth.py - compute the PSTH for a stepped inhomogeneous 
                     gamma renewal process with a!=1.0.
