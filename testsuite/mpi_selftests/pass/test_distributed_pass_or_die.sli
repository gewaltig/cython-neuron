Name: testsuite::test_distributed_pass_or_die - self test of distributed_pass_or_die

Synopsis: nest_indirect distributed_pass_or_die.sli -> -


Description:

 This is a self test of distributed_pass_or_die. The function needs to
 be able to collect the results of an arbitrary number of jobs and
 checks whether all jobs return true for all runs; this will only be the
 case if the code for all jobs completes and leaves the stack empty.
